BackTalk project history
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2.01 - Removed MCI_DOS_QUEUE Warp 4 specific MCI_OPEN flag (sorry).  Now
       should work with Warp 3 no problem.  And one less useless thread.
     - Fixed possible hang.

2.0  - Complete remake of BackTalk main engine.
       It is now integral part of the audio engine (which has also been
       reworked a lot).  You will notice major performance, solidity and
       functionality increase.  Noticeably amplification, realtime volume
       adjusting, and realtime queue status watching.  To access BackTalk,
       there are now ready-to-use functions in DLL for both REXX scripts
       and programming languages such as C.  Enjoy!

1.3  - Included PMAUD 1.1 as a part of a kludge.
     - Installation now proposes testing of 7 options (including kludge ;)
     - SPKIRC, speaking IRC REXX script!  Many options
     - SPCHTIME -> SPKCLOCK
     - SPCHTMR  -> SPKTIMER
     - Whole new SPKCLOCK from J Hulley-Miller <jhm@pobox.com>
     - Enhanced and bug fixed SPKTIMER
     - SPEECHQ.CMD will now execute SPKSTART.CMD after loading
     - SPKMAIL now specifies high priority and fowarded e-mail
     - Included Info-ZIP UNZIP.EXE (easier install?)

1.2  - Included Rsynth 2.1 and 2.2.
     - New speaking REXX scripts: SPCHTIME and SPCHTMR.
     - Readme updated accordingly, plus a "how to use in REXX" section.
     - Removed 16 bit playback by default.
     - Fixed bugs here and there

1.1  Revised by Samuel Audet
     - Bug fixed and ameliorated SPKMAIL and SPEECHQ.
     - Included Rsynth 2.2.
     - Changed the INSTALL program so I could understand it.
     - Updated readme accordingly.
